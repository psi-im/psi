Requirements
------------

* You need Qt 4.4 or higher to build Psi. If a packaged version of Qt is not
available for your OS (or if you want debug symbols in your Qt libraries), you
will need to build and install Qt 4.4 yourself. See the Qt instructions to find
out how to do this.

* You need QCA 2.0 and the QCA OpenSSL plugin, which you can get at
		https://userbase.kde.org/QCA
Instructions on how to build these packages can be found below.

The 'Building QCA' and 'Building QCA the OpenSSL plugin' sections can be
skipped by downloading the sources of these packages, and unpackaging them
in third-party/qca (see the INSTALL file for the exact location of each
package).


Building QCA
------------

After unpacking the QCA sources, run the following command:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/qca2

If configure cannot find your Qt4 library, use the --qtdir option to specify
the path to Qt (e.g. /usr/share/qt4), or make sure that the qmake binary for
Qt4 occurs first in your PATH. If something else goes wrong, use the --verbose
option to get more information on the configuration process.

After QCA configured, run

 make
 make install

To be able to run applications using QCA2, you will need to add
/usr/local/qca2/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig, or add
/usr/local/qca2/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.



Building the QCA OpenSSL plugin
-------------------------------
After unpacking the QCA OpenSSL plugin's sources, run the following commands

 ./configure
 make
 make install

See above on how to troubleshoot configure problems.



Building the QCA GnuPG plugin
-------------------------------
After unpacking the QCA GnuPG plugin's sources, run the following commands

 ./configure
 make
 make install

See above on how to troubleshoot configure problems.


Building Psi
------------

From the toplevel Psi source dir, run the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/psi
 make
 make install

This should configure, build, and install Psi. See above on how to
troubleshoot configure problems.
