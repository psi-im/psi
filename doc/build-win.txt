Requirements
------------

* You need Qt 4.4 or higher to build Psi. Just download and install the
MingW32 self-installer. All the instructions below are performed from within
the Qt command prompt (found in the Start menu)

* You need QCA 2.0 and the QCA OpenSSL plugin, which you can get at
		http://delta.affinix.com/qca/
Instructions on how to build these packages can be found below.

* If you want to use the QCA OpenSSL plugin on Windows, you will need to
download and install the OpenSSL package from
		http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html

The 'Building QCA' and 'Building QCA the OpenSSL plugin' sections can be
skipped by downloading the sources of these packages, and unpackaging them
in third-party/qca (see the INSTALL file for the exact location of each
package). Then, uncomment the 'CONFIG += qca-static' in conf_windows.pri.


Building QCA
------------

* Edit crypto_win.prf and change the QCA_PATH to the dir where you unpacked
QCA. Then, change -lqca to -lqca2.

* Copy crypto_win.prf to the mkspecs/features subdir of your Qt dir, and
rename it to crypto.prf.

* In the src/ dir, run the following commands:

   qmake
   mingw32-make

* Copy lib/qca2.dll to your system dir (e.g. \Windows\System32)



Building the QCA OpenSSL plugin
-------------------------------

* Go to the dir where you unpacked OpenSSL. In the lib\MingW subdir of that
dir, copy the files ssleay32.a and libeay32.a to ssleay32.lib and libeay32.lib
respectively.

* Edit qca-openssl.pro, and change the OPENSSL_PREFIX in the windows section
to point to the dir where you installed OpenSSL (e.g. C:/OpenSSL).
Change -L$$OPENSSL_PREFIX/lib into -L$$OPENSSL_PREFIX/lib/MingW.

* Run the following commands: 

   qmake
   mingw32-make



Building Psi
------------

* Edit src/src.pro in the Psi tree, and remove the line CONFIG += debug.

* From the toplevel dir in your tree, run the following commands:

   qmake
   mingw32-make

* There should now be a binary psi.exe in src/release.



Packaging Psi
-------------

To package everything up into a self-containing dir, edit win32/Makefile to
reflect your local setup, and run

   mingw32-make -C win32

This should make a dir win32/psi with all the necessary files.
