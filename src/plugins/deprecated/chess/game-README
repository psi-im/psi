~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This software is distributed under GNU GPL.

To compile the game you need Qt library version 3.2 or newer.
Also you need to set QTDIR environvent variable.
Read Qt manual for more info.
Then just type make -f Makefile.gnu and wait for a few time.
If you use FreeBSD you may type Makefile.FreeBSD.

The game uses TCP port 1345, you may change it at gamesocket.h

Maybe I'll write HTTP-proxy support... maybe!
