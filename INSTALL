Compiling
---------

Requirements:
  - Qt 4.4.0
  - QCA 2.0 or higher. This can either be installed system-wide,
    or you can use the bundled version found in the third-party/qca dir
    of the Psi source tree, and Psi will auto-detect it at configure time. 
    The different QCA packages should be unpacked in the following locations:
        - QCA 2.0: third-party/qca/qca
        - QCA OpenSSL (optional): third-party/qca/qca-openssl
        - QCA GnuPG (optional): third-party/qca/qca-gnupg

You can obtain Qt at http://qt.nokia.com/

You can obtain QCA at http://delta.affinix.com/qca/
