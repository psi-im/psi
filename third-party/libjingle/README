Libjingle

Libjingle is a set of components provided by Google to interoperate with Google
Talk's peer-to-peer and voice capabilities. This package will create several
static libraries you may link to your project as needed.

-talk               - No source files in talk/, just these subdirectories
|-base              - Contains basic low-level portable utility functions for 
|                     things like threads and sockets
|-p2p               - The P2P stack
  |-base            - Base p2p functionality
  |-client          - Hooks to tie it into XMPP
|-session           - Signaling
  |-phone           - Signaling code specific to making phone calls
|-third_party       - Components that aren't ours
  |-mediastreamer   - Media components for dealing with sound hardware and 
  |                   voice codecs
|-xmllite           - XML parser
|-xmpp              - XMPP engine

In addition, this package contains two examples in talk/examples which 
illustrate the basic concepts of how the provided classes work.

The xmllite component of libjingle depends on expat. You can download expat 
from http://expat.sourceforge.net/.

mediastreamer, the media components used by the example applications depend on
the oRTP and iLBC components from linphone, which can be found at 
http://www.linphone.org. Linphone, in turn depends on GLib, which can be found
at http://www.gtk.org. This GLib dependency should be removed in future 
releases.

Building Libjingle

Once the dependencies are installed, run ./configure. ./configure will return
an error if it failed to locate the proper dependencies. If ./configure
succeeds, run 'make' to build the components and examples.

When the build is complete, you can run the call example from 
talk/examples/call and the pcp example from talk/examples/pcp.

Relay Server

Libjingle will also build a relay server that may be used to relay traffic
when a direct peer-to-peer connection could not be established. The relay
server will build in talk/p2p/base/relayserver and will listen on UDP
ports 5000 and 5001. See the Libjingle Developer Guide at 
http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html for information about configuring
a client to use this relay server.

STUN Server

Lastly, Libjingle builds a STUN server which implements the STUN protocol for
Simple Traversal of UDP over NAT. The STUN server is built as
talk/p2p/base/stunserver and listens on UDP port 7000. See the Libjingle
Developer Guide at http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html for information
about configuring a client to use this STUN server.
