Notes
-----
  - QCA --
    * QCA 2.x is required to build Psi.
    * The qca-ossl and qca-gnupg plugins are desirable for full functionality
      of Psi.

  - Voice Calling --
    * The PsiMedia 1.0.x plugin and the qca-ossl plugin are needed to activate
      the voice calling feature. Source of PsiMedia can be found at:
        http://delta.affinix.com/psimedia/
      On Windows, place gstprovider.dll into the base directory.
      On Mac, place libgstprovider.dylib into Psi.app/Contents/plugins
      On Linux, place libgstprovider.so into LIBDIR/psi/plugins

  - Upgrading to 0.15 --
    * During the upgrade process, any existing files will be copied to new
      locations. You can opt to have the files in the original locations
      removed or left intact.

  - GnuPG tips --
    * Always use the latest version of GnuPG.
    * On Windows, use a native build instead of one based on cygwin, and make
      sure it is properly installed in the registry.
    * Ensure 'gpg' actually works, by testing it from the command-line.
    * You must have a public and secret keyring. Psi cannot operate
      without them, and they must be there when you start it.

Description
-----------

  Psi is a capable XMPP client aimed at experienced users. Its design goals
  are simplicity and stability. Psi is highly portable and runs on Windows,
  Unix/X11, and Mac OS X.

  The interface is very ICQ-like. Alerts appear in the contact list when
  events are received, and things like subscriptions requests appear as
  "system messages" (ICQ users know these well).  Even "Chats" are queued in
  the contact list. Also, chats are "remembered" by default, so that you don't
  have to keep a bunch of windows open for each person. Just close the
  chat window. If you open it again it will all be there.

  Psi is minimal but powerful. There are keybindings for just about
  everything, Unicode is supported throughout, and contacts are cached
  offline. Security is also a major consideration, and Psi provides it for
  both client-to-server (SSL) and client-to-client (GnuPG).
