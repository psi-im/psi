Known Issues
------------
The following are known issues with this release:
Issues with Qt 4.2.3: There is a bug in Qt 4.2.3 that corrupts incoming text
with rare Unicode characters (outside of the BMP)
Issues with Qt 4.3.(0|1): On X11 Qt 4.3 seems to have problems with some
window managers that result in windows not beeing displayed or displayed 
with a broken layout.
Issues with Qt 4.3.3: On Windows, qmake has a bug which prevents compilation with mingw, using an earlier Qt or qmake should work.

Notes
-----
  - QCA --
    * QCA2 is required to build Psi: a version is bundled with Psi.
    * The qca-ossl and qca-gnupg plugins are desirable for full 
      functionality of Psi.

  - Upgrading to 0.12 --
    * During the upgrade process, the old config.xml configuration file will
      be imported into the new option.xml format. Neither file should now be
      edited by hand, since all options are exposed in the options window. 
      Config.xml can be safely removed once the upgrade is complete.

  - GnuPG tips --
    * Always use the latest version of GnuPG.
    * On Windows, use a native build instead of one based on cygwin, and make
      sure it is properly installed in the registry.
    * Ensure 'gpg' actually works, by testing it from the command-line.
    * You must have a public and secret keyring.  Psi cannot operate
      without them, and they must be there when you start it.


Changes
-------
  New in 0.12

    servers not supporting PEP.

    problems with the QCA security layer.

Description
-----------

  Psi is a capable Jabber client aimed at experienced users.  Its design
  goals are simplicity and stability.  Psi is highly portable and runs on
  Windows, Unix/X11, and Mac OS X.

  The interface is very ICQ-like.  Alerts appear in the contact list when
  events are received, and things like subscriptions requests appear as
  "system messages" (ICQ users know these well).  Even "Chats" are
  queued in the contact list.  Also, chats are "remembered" by default,
  so that you don't have to keep a bunch of windows open for each person.
  Just close the chat window.  If you open it again it will all be there.

  Psi is minimal but powerful.  There are keybindings for just about
  everything, Unicode is supported throughout, and contacts are cached
  offline.  Security is also a major consideration, and Psi provides it for
  both client-to-server (SSL) and client-to-client (GnuPG).
